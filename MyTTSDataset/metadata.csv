ah-01.wav|I'm Andrew Huberman, and I'm a professor of neurobiology and ophthalmology
ah-02.wav|Stanford School of Medicine
ah-04.wav|Today we are discussing
ah-05.wav|happiness
ah-07.wav|We're going to discuss the science of happiness, because indeed
ah-09.wav|there are excellent laboratories
ah-10.wav|that have worked for many decades to try and understand what is this thing that we call happiness
ah-11.wav|and what brings us happiness
ah-13.wav|in the short and long term
ah-15.wav|In fact, we could probably point to happiness
ah-16.wav|as one of the most sought-after states
ah-17.wav|or commodities, or emotions. Whatever you want to call it
ah-19.wav|happiness is what many people are seeking
ah-21.wav|in work
ah-22.wav|in relationships
ah-24.wav|and in general
ah-26.wav|And yet most of us can't really define exactly what happiness is
ah-27.wav|or means for us
ah-29.wav|We can point to certain experiences
ah-30.wav|we can try and describe our states of mind and body
ah-32.wav|but most people recognize the feeling when we have it
ah-34.wav|and we certainly recognize the feeling of not being happy
ah-36.wav|Whether or not that means simply not being happy as the absence of happiness or
ah-37.wav|all-out depression
ah-38.wav|Now one of the key problems in trying to understand happiness and, indeed, the science and psychology of happiness
ah-40.wav|is that
ah-41.wav|it does indeed involve other similar things
ah-42.wav|Things like joy
ah-43.wav|and gratitude
ah-44.wav|and meaning
ah-46.wav|And indeed
ah-47.wav|many scientists and psychologists have argued
ah-48.wav|for many, many decades about what
ah-49.wav|happiness really is
ah-51.wav|Now we can come up with so-called operational definitions of happiness. Operational definitions
ah-52.wav|are basically agreed-upon terms
ah-53.wav|or agreed-upon definitions and conditions
ah-54.wav|that will define something such as happiness. Much in the same way that we can all
ah-55.wav|probably come up with an operational definition of milk
ah-56.wav|But of course, milk can be
ah-57.wav|cow's milk, it can be oat milk, it can be soy milk, et cetera, et cetera
ah-58.wav|So too, something like happiness can be micro-divided and sliced and diced into
ah-59.wav|as many things as we decide
ah-60.wav|Today we are really going to focus on three main things
ah-61.wav|First, we are going to define happiness
ah-62.wav|as a brain state and as a state of mind and body
ah-64.wav|We're going to take a look at what the science says about all of that
ah-65.wav|Second, we are going to talk about
ah-66.wav|tools and practices
ah-67.wav|for placing ourselves into states of happiness
ah-69.wav|And while
ah-70.wav|for most of us, we think of happiness as something that only arrives through the acquisition of some goal or some
ah-71.wav|thing external to us
ah-73.wav|and of course that
ah-74.wav|is true
ah-76.wav|There is also something called synthetic happiness or synthesized happiness which turns out to be at least as powerful and perhaps even more powerful
ah-78.wav|Now I'll just say right off the bat that I'm not going to tell you that all you have to do is sit in a chair and imagine being happy in order to feel happy
ah-79.wav|Synthesize happiness actually involves some very concrete steps that have been
ah-80.wav|defined by excellent labs in psychology, so we're going to talk about
ah-81.wav|synthesize happiness
ah-83.wav|as it relates to what you can do
ah-84.wav|to obtain happy states more readily or more frequently
ah-86.wav|And then, third
ah-87.wav|we're going to talk about some of the misconceptions or what I would call the contradictions of happiness research
ah-89.wav|And what I mean by that
ah-90.wav|is most of you have probably heard
ah-91.wav|about the
ah-92.wav|general conditions for obtaining happiness
ah-93.wav|And they always seem to circle back to some of the same basic features of
ah-94.wav|get great sleep
ah-96.wav|have great social connection
ah-97.wav|pursue meaning
ah-98.wav|don't focus
ah-99.wav|to
ah-100.wav|any
ah-101.wav|overextend on things like pursuing money because there are indeed these studies that show that the amount of money that people
ah-103.wav|make does not
ah-104.wav|necessarily scale directly with happiness
ah-107.wav|We'll talk about those studies in some detail a little bit later
ah-109.wav|And while all of that literature is very powerful
ah-111.wav|and
ah-112.wav|informative
ah-115.wav|there is what I see as a contradiction
ah-116.wav|Which is for instance
ah-117.wav|that for many of us
ah-118.wav|including myself
ah-119.wav|especially in the years when I was in graduate school and a postdoc
ah-120.wav|there were times in which
ah-121.wav|pursuing
ah-122.wav|nd being involved in work and pursuing degrees and
ah-124.wav|finding meaning in
ah-125.wav|my vocation
ah-126.wav|actually separated me from the opportunity to have quite as many social connections
ah-128.wav|or quite as much sleep, or quite as much exercise, or even quite as much sunshine
ah-129.wav|for that matter
ah-130.wav|So all of the things that we're told
ah-131.wav|that we need in order to access happiness on a regular basis
ah-133.wav|oftentimes contradict with the
ah-134.wav|pressures and the requirements of not just daily life but
ah-135.wav|in building a life
ah-137.wav|that allows us to have the kind of resources that we need in order to have things like
ah-138.wav|quality social connection
ah-139.wav|and
ah-140.wav|the time and opportunity to get regular exercise and great nutrition, et cetera, et cetera
ah-141.wav|So, again, while this isn't necessarily a complaint with any of the research
ah-142.wav|out of the fields of psychology on
ah-143.wav|happiness
ah-144.wav|it is
ah-145.wav|important that we acknowledge these contradictions that exist
ah-146.wav|in the discussion around happiness. In particular, the popular discussions around the science of happiness
ah-147.wav|So today, what we are going to
ah-148.wav|arrive at
ah-149.wav|what you will finish this episode, with 
ah-150.wav|is a set of tools and a framework for understanding
ah-151.wav|the pursuit of happiness in the short and long-term as it relates to the research from psychology but also
ah-152.wav|the neuroscience
ah-154.wav|And my goal today is really to try and place that all into a structured framework
ah-155.wav|so that you can
ah-156.wav|know where you are in
ah-157.wav|your journey or the landscape around happiness in your pursuit of happiness
ah-158.wav|And what I won't tell you is that you need to abandon all goals in terms of pursuing
ah-159.wav|money
ah-160.wav|career
ah-161.wav|et cetera
ah-162.wav|and simply focus on relationships. But we will
ah-163.wav|talk about
ah-164.wav|what constitutes
ah-165.wav|an excellent social bond or even in excellent conversation. There's
ah-166.wav|excellent research
ah-168.wav|that points to the fact that
ah-170.wav|even rather shallow connections, that is, connections between people that you happen to just see in the hallway
ah-171.wav|on a regular basis
ah-172.wav|not even requiring close
ah-173.wav|bonds of any kind, can be
ah-174.wav|built into close bonds that can deliver a tremendous amount of
ah-175.wav|feeling and genuine social connection provided certain conditions are met
ah-176.wav|So today, again, it's really about understanding
ah-177.wav|the science of happiness, understanding the mechanisms underlying what we call happiness. And
ah-178.wav|providing you a framework by which
ah-179.wav|you can pursue and achieve happiness
ah-180.wav|ot just as a long-term goal and not just as
ah-181.wav|a day-to-day goal of little micro exercises of gratitude, et cetera
ah-183.wav|but rather
ah-184.wav|as a way to think about happiness
ah-185.wav|as a state that you have control over, at least in terms of your ability to access
ah-186.wav|what I would call the algorithms that
ah-187.wav|enable us or
ah-188.wav|open the opportunity to experience happiness. Now before we begin today's episode, I'd like to talk about a very specific tool
ah-189.wav|that applies yes to our pursuit of happiness but actually to our pursuit of everything, including quality sleep and ongoing motivation, et cetera
ah-191.wav|I've talked many, many times before on this podcast and on other podcasts, and on social media
ah-192.wav|about the critical value
ah-193.wav|of getting
ah-194.wav|regular
ah-195.wav|bright light, ideally sunlight, in your eyes
ah-196.wav|within the first hour of waking. Or
ah-197.wav|if the sun isn't
ah-198.wav|out
ah-199.wav|when you wake up in the morning
ah-201.wav|to turn on a lot of bright artificial lights and then get sunlight in your eyes for anywhere from five
ah-202.wav|to twenty minutes, depending on how cloudy it is
ah-204.wav|in the early part of the day
ah-205.wav|Absolutely outsized effects mood and focus during the day and quality of sleep at night
ah-207.wav|Now there's another sort of central tenet
ah-209.wav|of
ah-210.wav|getting great sleep
ah-211.wav|and improving mood and focus throughout the day. And that's to avoid bright artificial light exposure to your eyes between the hours of about ten PM to four AM
ah-212.wav|Now leaving shift workers aside, and we have an entire episode devoted to shift work, most people are asleep at night and awake during the day
ah-213.wav|And you would be wise to avoid
ah-214.wav|exposure of your eyes to bright artificial light between the hours of ten PM
ah-215.wav|and four AM
ah-216.wav|If you're going to use screens or artificial lights, dim them down as far as you can
ah-217.wav|Now there are several studies that point to the fact
ah-218.wav|that
ah-219.wav|one of the major issues with getting
ah-220.wav|bright light in your eyes between the hours of ten PM and four AM
ah-221.wav|is that  it has a negative impact on the so-called dopaminergic or dopamine circuits of the brain and body, which can
ah-222.wav|enhance depression. That is
ah-223.wav|lead to
ah-224.wav|ongoing lower mood and affect
ah-225.wav|So that's a reason to dim the lights or avoid
ah-226.wav|bright lights between ten PM and four AM. However
ah-227.wav|I and many others need
ah-228.wav|to use artificial light and screens
ah-229.wav|sometimes, even between the hours of
ah-230.wav|ten PM and midnight or even midnight to three AM, depending on
ah-231.wav|what's going on in my life or your life
ah-232.wav|That may include you as well
ah-233.wav|Now it turns out that there are powerful ways to offset
ah-234.wav|some, not all, but some of the negative effects
ah-236.wav|of viewing artificial lights between the hours of ten PM
ah-237.wav|and four AM. And one of the most powerful ways to do that
ah-238.wav|is to simply adjust the overall brightness of your artificial lighting throughout the day and in the evening
ah-241.wav|So one of the
ah-242.wav|issues nowadays that we're really facing is that people are simply not getting enough bright light in their eyes from sunlight or from other sources during the daytime
ah-243.wav|and they're getting far too much bright light in their eyes
ah-244.wav|largely from artificial sources, of course
ah-245.wav|in the evening
ah-246.wav|and at night
ah-247.wav|Not just from ten PM to four AM, but also in the evening hours from six to ten PM and so on and so forth
ah-248.wav|So a very simple
ah-249.wav|yet powerful solution that supported by peer-reviewed
ah-250.wav|research in humans
ah-252.wav|is to try and make your indoor working and/or home environment during the day
ah-253.wav|as bright as possible. Now, if you can achieve that through direct sunlight, terrific. If you can get outside a lot during the daytime, terrific. But many people simply cannot
ah-254.wav|But most people do have some windows in their environment
ah-255.wav|I realize some don't but, most people do
ah-257.wav|And as a consequence, most people are using rather dim artificial lighting
ah-259.wav|indoors
ah-260.wav|during the day
ah-261.wav|and then very bright artificial lighting
ah-262.wav|indoors
ah-263.wav|in the evening, and at night
ah-265.wav|that's a problem. And if you think about it, logically, you want to do the exact reverse
ah-266.wav|So it's been shown that if you
ah-267.wav|simply increase the amount of bright artificial light that you were exposed to during the day
ah-268.wav|and remember this is not an excuse to not get your
ah-269.wav|morning sunlight viewing, but in addition to that
ah-270.wav|to make
ah-271.wav|your indoor artificial lights very bright, bright, bright, bright, bright throughout the day
ah-272.wav|And then much dimmer from the hours of six PM
ah-273.wav|until bedtime
ah-274.wav|Or if you can't do that, then maybe
ah-275.wav|as
